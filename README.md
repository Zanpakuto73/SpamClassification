# SpamClassification


This is a Spam Analysis Machine Learning Project that my partner and I created for a final project in our machine learning class.
We used LogRocket as a foundation for our code and this is the link to the article: https://blog.logrocket.com/email-spam-detector-python-machine-learning/
Additionally, the dataset we used originated on kaggle from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venky73/spam-mails-dataset

Once we attain the dataset, we split the dataset for training and testing and then preprocess the training and test sets that contain the email content. Our spam email analysis classifier uses 5 models. One is a stacking classifier that takes in base classifier and a meta learner. We used SVM, Random Forest Classifier, and multinomial Na√Øve Bayes as base classifiers and use Linear Regression as the meta learner. A chart is created to compare each model and to show their accuracy for the training and testing data. Some of the models do not perform well because we used hyperparameters to prevent overfitting for the stacking classifier.
Next, we have two test samples, one is legit email and the other is a spam email text. The email text of both will be preprocessed and then predicted on by the stacking classifier. If the prediction returns 'ham' then it will classify it as Not email spam. However if it classifies it as 'spam', then it will return This is a spam email.
Lastly, as a final requirement, we inserted code to save the model model and tokenizer in case of future use for anyone.
